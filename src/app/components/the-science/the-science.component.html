        <h2>What is Vascular Dysfunction?</h2>
        <p>Vascular dysfunction is related to <span>Endothelial Dysfunction</span> which is associated with arterial
          stiffness, microcirculation disorders, and Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD).</p>
        <p>Endothelial dysfunction is characterized by a reduction of the bioavailability of <span>Nitric Oxide
            (NO),</span> which upsets the balance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation, and initiates a number of
          processes that
          promote hypertension.</p>
        <p>In addition, endothelial damage includes increased endothelial permeability, <span>platelet aggregation,
            pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulatory states,</span> and monocytes migration from the blood into the
          subendothelial intima and transformation into macrophages, which accumulate lipids to form the lipid core of
          atherosclerotic plaque and increase arterial stiffness.</p>
        <p><span>Endothelial</span> dysfunction can be caused by several conditions, including diabetes or metabolic
          syndrome, hypertension, smoking, and physical inactivity </p>

        <p><strong>The assessments</strong> of the autonomic nervous system, endothelial function, and Ankle-Brachial
          Index (ABI) are well-recognized tests to detect early complications in diabetic patients – diabetic neuropathy
          risk, cardiovascular risk, and peripheral artery disease.
          <span>These assessments are recommended by the U.S. and International Medical Associations. </span>
          Unfortunately, most of these assessments or exams are not routinely performed in daily clinical practice
          because
          of concerns about complex procedures, time consumption, and a high level of difficulty in reading and/or
          interpreting exam reports.
        </p>
        <p><span>Our ANS testing medical device platform</span> eliminates these concerns by offering an innovative
          medical device that provides physicians with new and easy to use tools that simplify complex procedures,
          significantly reduces the time required by technicians to perform the exams, and offers easy to read and
          interpret exam reports with clinical guidance support which is backed by studies and peer reviews. Lastly, our
          most recent innovation includes wireless transmission to increase patient and technician comfort.</p>

        <p><strong>Conventional medical exams</strong> blood lab tests, Doppler, EKG, blood pressure measurements, etc.)
          are commonly used to diagnose diseases, but these exam markers can be too narrowly used today in treatment
          management – e.g.,
          <span>Diabetes and high blood pressure. It is well understood that diabetes is a state marked by increased
            blood glucose levels, and the treatment is narrowly focused on reducing the blood lab test/s
            marker/s.</span>
          The same narrow focus is true with Hypertension. High blood pressure treatment is focused on increasing blood
          flow. However, it’s not enough to focus on treatment that only reduces the disease diagnostic marker. Why?
          Because diabetes, high blood pressure, or vascular disease are complex chronic diseases that negatively affect
          homeostasis by damaging the body’s regulatory functions.
        </p>
        <p><span>Homeostasis</span> refers to stability, balance, or equilibrium within a cell or the body. It is an
          organism’s ability to keep a constant internal environment. Homeostasis is an important characteristic of
          living things. Keeping a stable internal environment requires constant adjustments as conditions change inside
          and outside the cell. The adjusting of systems within a cell is called homeostatic regulation. Because the
          internal and external environments of a cell are constantly changing, adjustments must be made continuously to
          stay at or near the setpoint (the normal level or range). Homeostasis can be thought of as a dynamic
          equilibrium rather than a constant, unchanging state.</p>

        <h3><strong>Homeostatic</strong> regulation is adjusted by 2 main body networks:
          Autonomic nerves and Endothelial cells.</h3>
        <p>When the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and endothelial functions are properly working, the patient is in
          good health and has a high potential for recovery.</p>
        <p>When one of the regulation’s functions fails or is stressed beyond its genetic potential for different
          reasons - inadequate lifestyle, aging, weak genetics, then disease may occur.</p>
        <p>Lab tests show the damage of the regulation functions when the disease is already onset. By assessing the
          regulation functions, we could have early detection of a future potential disease when the treatment options
          can delay or reverse a condition or disease.</p>
        <p>The conventional exams cannot detect Cardiac Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) or endothelial dysfunction symptoms,
          and patients suffering from these symptoms cannot be treated effectively.</p>
        <p>When a disease is diagnosed, the treatment management should not only control the disease diagnosis marker
          but also restore or maintain the regulations’ functions: Autonomic nervous system and endothelial functions.

    <div class="newcontainer">
      <div class="textwrapper">
        <h4>1. AUTONOMOUS NERVOUS SYSTEM DYSFUNCTION RISK - ANSD</h4>
        <p>Problems with the ANS can range from mild to life-threatening. Sometimes, only one part of the nervous system is affected. In other cases, the entire ANS is affected. Some conditions are temporary and can be reversed, while others are chronic and will continue to worsen over time. Diseases such as Diabetes or Parkinson’s Disease can cause irregularities with ANS.
          <span>Problems with ANS regulation often involve organ failure,</span> or the failure of the nerves to transmit a necessary signal.
        </p>
        <h4>2. SUDOMOTOR DYSFUNCTION RISK - SudoD</h4>
        <p>Sudomotor dysfunction testing may indicate to physicians a patient's peripheral nerve and cardiac sympathetic dysfunction. <span>Neuropathy is a common complication in diabetes mellitus (DM), with 60%-70% of patients affected over their lifetime.</span>
          Symptoms of neuropathy are more common than clinical neuropathy. Neuropathy may remain undetected, and progress over time leading to serious complications. The most common associated clinical condition is peripheral neuropathy, affecting the feet. Autonomic nerve involvement is common but probably the most undiagnosed. Low scores in the sudomotor may lead a medical provider to look at clinical neuropathy.

    <div class="newcontainer">
      <div class="textwrapper">
        <h4>3. ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION RISK - EndoD</h4>
        <p>Current evidence suggests that endothelial function is an integrative marker of the net effects of damage from traditional and emerging risk factors on the arterial wall and its intrinsic capacity for repair. <span>Endothelial dysfunction,</span> detected as the presence of reduced vasodilating response to 
          endothelial stimuli, has been observed to be associated with major cardiovascular risk factors, such as aging, hyperhomocysteinemia, post-menopause state, smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, 
          and hypertension.</p>
        <h4>4. INSULIN RESISTANCE RISK - IR</h4>
        <p>Insulin resistance is defined clinically as the inability of a known quantity of exogenous or 
          endogenous insulin to increase glucose uptake and utilization in an individual as much as it does in a normal population. Insulin resistance occurs as part of a cluster of cardiovascular metabolic 
          abnormalities commonly referred to as <span>"The Insulin Resistance Syndrome" or "The Metabolic 
            Syndrome".</span> This cluster of abnormalities may lead to the development of Type-2 diabetes, 
            accelerated atherosclerosis, hypertension, or polycystic ovarian syndrome depending on the genetic background of the individual developing insulin resistance.</p>

    <div class="newcontainer">
      <div class="textwrapper">
        <h4>5. CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK - CMR</h4>
        <p>The specific factors that can cause this increased risk include obesity (particularly central), 
          hyperglycemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipoproteinemia. When patients have one or more risk factors and are physically inactive or smoke, the cardiometabolic risk is increased even more. <span>Medical conditions that often share the above characteristics, such as type 2 diabetes,</span> can also increase cardiometabolic risk. The primary focus of cardiometabolic risk treatment is the man
          agement of each high-risk factor, including dyslipoproteinemia, hypertension, and diabetes. The 
          management of these subjects is based principally on lifestyle measures, but various antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, insulin-sensitizing, anti-obesity, and antiplatelet drugs could be helpful in reducing 
          cardiometabolic risk.</p>
        <h4>6. SMALL FIBER NEUROPATHY RISK - SFN</h4>
        <p>A small fiber neuropathy occurs when damage to the peripheral nerves predominantly or entirely affects the <span>small myelinated fibers or unmyelinated C fibers.</span> The specific fiber types involved in this process include both small somatic and autonomic fibers. The sensory functions of these fibers include thermal perception and nociception. These fibers are involved in many autonomic and enteric functions.</p>

      <div class="textwrapper">
        <h4>7. CARDIAC AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY RISK - CAN</h4>
        <p>High blood glucose levels over a period of years may cause a condition called autonomic neuropathy. This is damage to the nerves that control the regulation of involuntary function. When the nerve damage affects the heart, it is called cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN). <span>CAN encompasses damage to the autonomic nerve fibers that innervate the heart and blood vessels, </span> resulting in abnormalities in heart rate control, vascular dynamics, and the body's ability to adjust blood pressure. CAN is a 
          significant cause of morbidity and mortality associated with a high risk of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death.</p>
        <h4>8. PLETHYSMOGRAPHY CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK - PTG CVD</h4>
        <p>The PTG CVD risk factor is the combined total of the other seven risk factors assessments. It takes into consideration the cardiovascular as well as the autonomic nervous system <span>(ANS) measurements.</span></p>
